/*
  These are temporary styles to fix some layout problems that occur when mixing
  bootstrap and materialize (and materialize wins).

  DISCLAIMER: these may be hacky (use of .au-target) but since they are
              temporary I don't really care. :-)

  They will be removed when the catalog does not rely on bootstrap anymore.
